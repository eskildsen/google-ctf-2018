# Shall we play a game? - Fuck off, no
Currently Johan and Morten have tested numerous ways, to play the game a 1.000.000 times.
A .apk have been made (using Mortens computer), that does all the logic in the same way as the APK (almost).

The best way currently to play the game, is to compile some java code, and inject it into the original apk (smali code), this ensures that the code runs correct.

Playing the game 1.000.000 times takes alot of time, because of all the animations; remove that shit.

The end result is a 32 byte arary, which has values between -255 and 255.
